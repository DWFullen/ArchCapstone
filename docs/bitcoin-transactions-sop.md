# Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Bitcoin Transactions

## Purpose
This SOP provides a step-by-step guide for working with Bitcoin transactions, based on the official Bitcoin developer documentation. It is intended for developers and QA engineers working on Bitcoin-related projects.

## Reference
- [Bitcoin Developer Guide: Transactions](https://developer.bitcoin.org/examples/transactions.html)

## Prerequisites
- Access to a development environment with Bitcoin Core or a compatible node installed
- Familiarity with Bitcoin transaction structure and RPC commands
- Required dependencies and libraries installed for your application

## Procedure

### 1. Understand Transaction Structure
- Review the components of a Bitcoin transaction: inputs, outputs, and scripts.
- Study how transactions are constructed and validated.

### 2. Create a Raw Transaction
- Use the `createrawtransaction` RPC command to build a transaction:
  ```bash
  bitcoin-cli createrawtransaction '[{"txid":"<txid>","vout":0}]' '{"<address>":<amount>}'
  ```
- Replace `<txid>`, `<address>`, and `<amount>` with actual values.

### 3. Sign the Transaction
- Use the `signrawtransactionwithwallet` command:
  ```bash
  bitcoin-cli signrawtransactionwithwallet <hexstring>
  ```
- The output will be a signed transaction hex.

### 4. Broadcast the Transaction
- Use the `sendrawtransaction` command:
  ```bash
  bitcoin-cli sendrawtransaction <signedhex>
  ```
- Monitor the transaction status using `gettransaction` or block explorers.

### 5. Validate and Monitor
- Confirm the transaction is included in a block.
- Check confirmations and transaction details.

## Best Practices
- Always test transactions on regtest or testnet before mainnet.
- Validate all inputs and outputs before broadcasting.
- Keep private keys secure and never expose them in scripts.
- Log transaction IDs and monitor for confirmations.

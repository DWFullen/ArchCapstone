# Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Testing Bitcoin Applications

## Purpose
This SOP provides a step-by-step guide for testing Bitcoin applications, based on the official Bitcoin developer documentation. It is intended for developers and QA engineers working on Bitcoin-related projects.

## Reference
- [Bitcoin Developer Guide: Testing Applications](https://developer.bitcoin.org/examples/testing.html)

## Prerequisites
- Access to a development environment with Bitcoin Core or a compatible node installed
- Familiarity with Bitcoin transactions and RPC commands
- Required dependencies and libraries installed for your application

## Procedure

### 1. Set Up a Test Environment
- Use Bitcoin's testnet or regtest mode to avoid using real funds.
- Start a Bitcoin Core node in regtest mode:
  ```bash
  bitcoind -regtest -daemon
  ```
- Generate blocks to obtain test coins:
  ```bash
  bitcoin-cli -regtest generate 101
  ```

### 2. Create and Fund Test Wallets
- Create new wallets for testing:
  ```bash
  bitcoin-cli -regtest createwallet "testwallet"
  ```
- Get a new address:
  ```bash
  bitcoin-cli -regtest getnewaddress
  ```
- Send test coins to the address as needed.

### 3. Write and Run Automated Tests
- Use available Bitcoin libraries (e.g., bitcoinlib, bitcoinjs-lib) to interact with the node.
- Write tests to:
  - Create and broadcast transactions
  - Validate transaction confirmations
  - Test edge cases (e.g., double spends, invalid transactions)
- Use RPC calls to verify blockchain state and wallet balances.

### 4. Clean Up
- Remove or reset test wallets and data directories after testing.
- Stop the regtest node:
  ```bash
  bitcoin-cli -regtest stop
  ```

## Best Practices
- Always use regtest or testnet for development and testing.
- Automate tests as much as possible.
- Isolate test data from production data.
- Regularly update your test scripts to match application changes.

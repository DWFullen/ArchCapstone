# Load Balancing Options for Azure Container Apps

## Overview
This document outlines the available load balancing options for Azure Container Apps, focusing on three key services:

1. **Azure Application Gateway for Containers**
2. **Azure Traffic Manager**
3. **Azure Front Door**

Each option will be evaluated based on its architecture, implementation options, and associated costs. The final recommendation for this project is to use **Azure Front Door**.

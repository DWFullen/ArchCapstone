# Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Bitcoin Payment Processing

## Purpose
This SOP provides a step-by-step guide for implementing and testing Bitcoin payment processing, based on the official Bitcoin developer documentation. It is intended for developers and QA engineers working on Bitcoin payment solutions.

## Reference
- [Bitcoin Developer Guide: Payment Processing](https://developer.bitcoin.org/examples/payment_processing.html)

## Prerequisites
- Access to a development environment with Bitcoin Core or a compatible node installed
- Familiarity with Bitcoin addresses, transactions, and RPC commands
- Required dependencies and libraries installed for your application

## Procedure

### 1. Generate Payment Addresses
- Use the Bitcoin Core node or libraries to generate unique addresses for each payment.
- Example:
  ```bash
  bitcoin-cli getnewaddress
  ```
- Assign each address to a specific customer or order.

### 2. Monitor for Incoming Payments
- Use the `listtransactions` or `getreceivedbyaddress` RPC commands to detect incoming payments.
- Example:
  ```bash
  bitcoin-cli listtransactions
  bitcoin-cli getreceivedbyaddress <address>
  ```
- Confirm the required number of confirmations before processing the order.

### 3. Handle Payment Confirmations
- Wait for a configurable number of confirmations (commonly 1-6) before marking a payment as complete.
- Notify users or update order status upon confirmation.

### 4. Reconcile and Audit Payments
- Regularly reconcile received payments with expected invoices.
- Use logs and transaction IDs for auditing.

## Best Practices
- Always use unique addresses per payment to simplify tracking.
- Automate payment monitoring and confirmation processes.
- Securely store private keys and sensitive data.
- Test payment flows on regtest or testnet before mainnet deployment.
